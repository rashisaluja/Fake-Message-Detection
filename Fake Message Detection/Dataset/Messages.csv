,,"Various media sources have reported that about 8 in 10 people who test positive for COVID-19 have no symptoms. This follows results from the largest cross-sectional survey of the general population being carried out in England. The REACT-1 study has been sending viral testing kits and online questionnaires to over 120,000 people each month.

In May, 0.13% of 121,000 samples tested positive. In June, 0.08% of 160,000 samples tested positive. In both months, 70-80% of those testing positive had no symptoms in the past seven days.

The nasal and throat swabs only tell whether the person is carrying the COVID-19 virus at the time of testing ‚Äì they cannot inform whether they‚Äôve had it in the past. Although there may be practical difficulties in taking the swab sample, the results suggest that the current prevalence of COVID-19 in the community is very low and appears to be declining. The important thing is that the infection rate continues to fall and we do not experience a resurgence of cases.

Therefore the fact that many people with COVID appear to be asymptomatic and could transmit the infection without knowing it, highlights the need to continue to follow infection control measures.",Real,Fact based

There have now been a few case reports which appear to show that the infection can pass from the pregnant woman to the unborn baby, across the placenta. In one report from France, a baby was born to a woman who became ill with COVID-19 in late pregnancy. Placenta and newborn samples tested positive for the virus. The baby developed some neurological symptoms three days after birth, but recovered well and was discharged from hospital. In another US report, a pregnant woman with diabetes contracted COVID-19, and again placental samples tested positive. The baby tested positive for the virus 1-2 days after birth and showed mild breathing problems but made a full recovery.

Cases of the virus being passed from pregnant women to their unborn babies appear to be rare. These two cases excluded the possibility of transfer of the virus after birth but in other reports, without thorough testing, whether the infection was passed on in the womb or after birth is less clear. Reassuringly, there are no reports of a newborn baby becoming seriously unwell from COVID-19.

,,"WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 29 June 2020
29 June 2020
Good morning, good afternoon and good evening.

Tomorrow marks six months since WHO received the first reports of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in China.

The six-month anniversary of the outbreak coincides with reaching 10 million cases and 500,000 deaths. 

This is a moment for all of us to reflect on the progress we have made and the lessons we have learned, and to recommit ourselves to doing everything we can to save lives. 

Six months ago, none of us could have imagined how our world ‚Äì and our lives ‚Äì would be thrown into turmoil by this new virus.

The pandemic has brought out the best and the worst of humanity.

All over the world we have seen heartwarming acts of resilience, inventiveness, solidarity and kindness. 

But we have also seen concerning signs of stigma, misinformation and the politicization of the pandemic. 

For the past six months, WHO and our partners have worked relentlessly to support all countries to prepare for and respond to this new virus.

Today, we are publishing an updated and detailed timeline of WHO‚Äôs response to the pandemic on our website, so the public can have a look at what happened in the past six months in relation to the response. 

It illustrates the range of WHO‚Äôs work to stop transmission and save lives. 

We have worked with researchers, clinicians and other experts to bring together the evolving science and distil it into guidance. 

Millions of health workers have enrolled in courses through our OpenWHO.org online learning platform.

We launched the Solidarity Trial, to find answers fast to which drugs are the most effective.

We launched Solidarity Flights, to ship millions of test kits and tons of personal protective equipment to many countries. 

We launched the Solidarity Response Fund, which has raised more than US$223 million for the response.

Three major innovative solidarity activities.

And we have worked with the European Commission and multiple partners to launch the ACT Accelerator, to ensure that once a vaccine is available, it‚Äôs available to everyone ‚Äì especially those who are at greatest risk.

On Friday we launched the ACT Accelerator Investment Case, which estimates that more than US$31 billion will be needed to accelerate the development, equitable allocation and delivery of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics by the end of next year.

Over the weekend, WHO was proud to partner in the ‚ÄúGlobal Goal: Unite for Our Future‚Äù pledging conference, organized by the European Commission and Global Citizen. 

The event mobilized new resources to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic globally, including in support of the ACT Accelerator.

Although a vaccine will be an important long-term tool for controlling COVID-19, there are five priorities that every single country must focus on now, to save lives now.

First, empower communities. Every individual must understand that they are not helpless ‚Äì there are things everyone should do to protect themselves and others. Your health is in your hands.

That includes physical distancing, hand hygiene, covering coughs, staying home if you feel sick, wearing masks when appropriate, and only sharing information from reliable sources.

You may be in a low-risk category, but the choices you make could be the difference between life and death for someone else. 

Second, suppress transmission. Whether countries have no cases, clusters of cases or community transmission, there are steps all countries can take to suppress the spread of the virus.

Ensure that health workers have access to training and personal protective equipment.

Improve surveillance to find cases.

The single-most important intervention for breaking chains of transmission is not necessarily high-tech and can be carried out by a broad range of professionals. It‚Äôs tracing and quarantining contacts.

Many countries actually have used non-health professionals to do contact tracing.

Third, save lives.

Early identification and clinical care saves lives.

Providing oxygen and dexamethasone to people with severe and critical disease saves lives.

And paying special attention to high-risk groups, including elderly people in long-term care facilities, saves lives.

Japan has done this: it has one of the highest populations of elderly people, but its death rate is low, and the reason is what we just said ‚Äì many countries can do that, they can save lives.

Fourth, accelerate research.

We‚Äôve already learned a lot about this virus, but there‚Äôs still a lot we don‚Äôt know ‚Äì and there are still tools we need.

This week we will convene a second meeting to assess progress on research and development and re-evaluate research priorities for the next stage of the pandemic. 

And fifth, political leadership.

As we have said repeatedly, national unity and global solidarity are essential to implementing a comprehensive strategy to suppress transmission, save lives and minimize the social and economic impact of the virus. 

No matter what stage a country is at, these five priorities ‚Äì if acted on consistently and coherently ‚Äì can turn the tide.

WHO will continue to do everything in our power to serve countries with science, solidarity and solutions. 

The critical question that all countries will face in the coming months is how to live with this virus. That is the new normal. 

Many countries have implemented unprecedented measures to suppress transmission and save lives.

These measures have been successful in slowing the spread of the virus. But they have not completely stopped it. 

Some countries are now experiencing a resurgence of cases as they start to re-open their economies and societies.

Most people remain susceptible. The virus still has a lot of room to move.

We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives. 

But the hard reality is: this is not even close to being over. 

Although many countries have made some progress, globally the pandemic is actually speeding up.

We‚Äôre all in this together, and we‚Äôre all in this for the long haul.

We will need even greater stores of resilience, patience, humility and generosity in the months ahead. 

We have already lost so much ‚Äì but we cannot lose hope. 

This is a time for renewing our commitment to empowering communities, suppressing transmission, saving lives, accelerating research and political and moral leadership.

But it‚Äôs also a time for all countries to renew their commitment to universal health coverage as the cornerstone of social and economic development ‚Äì and to building the safer, fairer, greener, more inclusive world we all want. 

I thank you.

17 June 2020

WHO announced that the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) arm of the Solidarity Trial to find an effective COVID-19 treatment was being stopped. 

The trial's Executive Group and principal investigators made the decision based on evidence from the Solidarity trial, UK's Recovery trial and a Cochrane review of other evidence on hydroxychloroquine. 

Data from Solidarity (including the French Discovery trial data) and the recently announced results from the UK's Recovery trial both showed that hydroxychloroquine does not result in the reduction of mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, when compared with standard of care. 

Investigators will not randomize further patients to hydroxychloroquine in the Solidarity trial. Patients who have already started hydroxychloroquine but who have not yet finished their course in the trial may complete their course or stop at the discretion of the supervising physician.

22 May 2020 

 COVID 19 is disrupting life-saving immunization services around the world, putting millions of children ‚Äì in rich and poor countries alike ‚Äì at risk of diseases like diphtheria, measles and polio. 

Provision of routine immunization services is substantially hindered in at least 68 countries and is likely to affect approximately 80 million children under the age of 1 living in these countries.

Since March 2020, routine childhood immunization services have been disrupted on a global scale that may be unprecedented since the inception of expanded programs on immunization (EPI) in the 1970s. 

The reasons for disrupted services vary. Some parents are reluctant to leave home because of restrictions on movement, lack of information or because they fear infection with the COVID-19 virus. And many health workers are unavailable because of restrictions on travel, or redeployment to COVID response duties, as well as a lack of protective equipment. Transport delays of vaccines are also exacerbating the situation.

Despite the challenges, several countries are making special efforts to continue immunization. Uganda is ensuring that immunization services continue along with other essential health services, even funding transportation to ensure outreach activities. And in Lao PDR, despite a national lockdown imposed in March, routine immunization in fixed sites continued with physical distancing measures in place.

Relatively few cases of infants confirmed to have COVID-19 have been reported; those who are infected have experienced mild illness.

Recently, however, reports from Europe and North America have described clusters of children and adolescents requiring admission to intensive care units with a multisystem inflammatory condition with some features similar to those of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. 

It is essential to characterize this syndrome and its risk factors, to understand causality, and describe treatment interventions. It is not yet clear the full spectrum of disease, and whether the geographical distribution in Europe and North America reflects a true pattern, or if the condition has simply not been recognized elsewhere.

There is therefore an urgent need for collection of standardized data describing clinical presentations, severity, outcomes, and epidemiology. WHO has developed a preliminary case definition and case report form for multisystem inflammatory disorder in children and adolescents. The case definition will be revised as more data become available.

13 May 2020

An increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety are already being reported in a number of countries in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. A study in Ethiopia in April 2020 reported a 3-fold increase in the prevalence of symptoms of depression compared to estimates from before the epidemic.

Frontline health-care workers, women, children, adolescents, older persons and people with pre-existing mental health conditions are all at particular risk. A rise in alcohol consumption is another area of concern for mental health experts.

The increase in people in need of mental health or psychosocial support has been compounded by the interruption to mental health services in many countries. 

In concrete terms, it is critical that people living with mental health conditions have continued access to treatment. Many countries have changed their approach to the provision of this support in ways that are showing signs of success.

11 May 2020 

COVID-19 is an infectious disease that primarily affects the lungs. Smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other diseases. Tobacco is also a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease and diabetes which put people with these conditions at higher risk for developing severe illness when affected by COVID-19. 

WHO is constantly evaluating new research, including research that examines the link between tobacco use, nicotine use, and COVID-19. A review of studies by public health experts convened by WHO on 29 April 2020 found that smokers are more likely to develop severe disease with COVID-19, compared to non-smokers.

WHO urges researchers, scientists and the media to be cautious about amplifying unproven claims that tobacco or nicotine could reduce the risk of COVID-19. There is currently insufficient information to confirm any link between tobacco or nicotine in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.

Generally speaking, digital technologies for rapid reporting, data management, and analysis will be helpful. Robust comprehensive surveillance should be maintained even in areas where there are few or no cases; it is critical that new cases and clusters are detected rapidly and before widespread disease transmission occurs. Ongoing surveillance is also important to understand longer-term trends in the disease and the evolution of the virus. 

Surveillance can be community-based and take place at the primary care level.

8 May 2020 

On May 8 1980, the World Health Assembly confirmed the eradication of smallpox, marking the end of a disease that had plagued humanity for at least 3000 years, killing 300 million people in the 20th century alone. 

It was ended thanks to a 10-year global effort, spearheaded by the World Health Organization, that involved thousands of health workers around the world to administer half a billion vaccinations to stamp out smallpox. 

Speaking at a virtual event hosted at WHO-HQ, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus outlined what the eradication of smallpox can teach us about using basic public health solutions, science and solidarity to rise to the challenge of COVID-19.

""Many of the basic public health tools that were used successfully then are the same tools that have been used to respond to Ebola, and to COVID-19: disease surveillance, case finding, contact tracing, and mass communication campaigns to inform affected populations.‚Äù 

Smallpox eradication was only possible because of a safe and effective vaccine. With COVID-19, WHO is working to drive forward the ‚ÄòAccess to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator‚Äô, which aims to ensure that new health technologies will be developed, manufactured and distributed equitably.

Dr Tedros noted that humanity‚Äôs victory over smallpox is a reminder of what is possible when nations come together to fight a common health threat: ""The decisive factor in the victory over smallpox was global solidarity. At the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the United States of America joined forces to conquer a common enemy.

Head of the Infectious Disease Clinic, University of Maryland, 
USA:

1. We may have to live with C19 for months or years. Let's not deny it or panic. Let's not make our lives useless. Let's learn to live with this fact. 

2. You can't destroy C19 viruses that have penetrated cell walls, drinking gallons of hot water - you'll just go to the bathroom more often.

3. Washing hands and maintaining a 
two-metre physical distance is the best method for your protection. 

4. If you don't have a C19 patient at home, there's no need to disinfect the surfaces at your house.

5. Packaged cargo, gas pumps, shopping carts and ATMs do not cause infection. 
Wash your hands, live your life as usual.

6. C19 is not a food infection. It is associated with drops of infection like the ‚Äòflu. There is no demonstrated risk that C19 is transmitted by ordering food.

7. You can lose your sense of smell with a lot of allergies and viral infections. This is only a non-specific symptom of C19.

8. Once at home, you don't need to change your clothes urgently and go shower! 
Purity is a virtue, paranoia is not! 

9. The C19 virus doesn't hang in the air. This is a respiratory droplet infection that requires close contact. 

10. The air is clean, you can walk through the gardens (just keeping your physical protection distance), through parks.

11. It is sufficient to use normal soap against C19, not antibacterial soap. This is a virus, not a bacteria.

12. You don't have to worry about your food orders. But you can heat it all up in the microwave, if you wish.

13. The chances of bringing C19 home with your shoes is like being struck by lightning twice in a day. I've been working against viruses for 20 years - drop infections don't spread like that!

14. You can't be protected from the virus by taking vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger! These are for immunity not a cure. 

15. Wearing a mask for long periods interferes with your breathing and oxygen levels. Wear it only in crowds. 

16. Wearing gloves is also a bad idea; the virus can accumulate into the glove and be easily transmitted if you touch your face. Better just to wash your hands regularly. 

17.  Immunity is greatly weakened by always staying in a sterile environment.  Even if you eat immunity boosting foods, please go out of your house regularly to any park/beach. 
Immunity is increased by EXPOSURE TO PATHOGENS,  not by sitting at home and consuming fried/spicy/sugary food and aerated drinks.

23 April 2020

A modelling analysis released today considered scenarios for potential disruptions in access to core malaria control tools during the COVID-19 pandemic in 41 countries. 

Under the worst-case scenario, in which all insecticide-treated net (ITN) campaigns are suspended and there is a 75% reduction in access to effective antimalarial medicines, the estimated tally of malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020 would reach 769 000, twice the number of deaths reported in the region in 2018. This would represent a return to malaria mortality levels last seen 20 years ago.

Countries across the region have a critical window of opportunity to minimize disruptions in malaria prevention and treatment and save lives at this stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.

No pharmaceutical products have yet been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19. However, a number of medicines have been suggested as potential investigational therapies, many of which are now being or will soon be studied in clinical trials, including the SOLIDARITY trial co-sponsored by WHO and participating countries.

In many countries, doctors are giving COVID-19 patients medicines that have not been approved for this disease. The use of licensed medicines for indications that have not been approved by a national medicines regulatory authority is considered ‚Äúoff-label‚Äù use. The prescription of medicines for off-label use by doctors may be subject to national laws and regulations. All health care workers should be aware of and comply with the laws and regulations governing their practice. Further, such prescribing should be done on a case-by-case basis. Unnecessary stockpiling and the creation of shortages of approved medicines that are required to treat other diseases should be avoided.

It can be ethically appropriate to offer individual patients experimental interventions on an emergency basis outside clinical trials, provided that no proven effective treatment exists; it is not possible to initiate clinical studies immediately; the patient or his or her legal representative has given informed consent; and the emergency use of the intervention is monitored, and the results are documented and shared in a timely manner with the wider medical and scientific community.[1]

The decision to offer a patient an unproven or experimental treatment is between the doctor and the patient but must comply with national law. Where it is possible and feasible for the treatment to be given as part of a clinical trial, this should be done unless the patient declines to participate in the trial.

If it is not possible to give the treatment as part of a clinical trial, appropriate records of the use of the medicine must be kept, in compliance with national law, and outcomes for patients should be monitored and recorded.

If early results from an unproven or experimental treatment are promising, the treatment should be studied in the context of a formal clinical trial to establish its safety, efficacy, risks, and benefits.",Real,Fact based

What is COVID-19?
COVID-19, also known as Coronavirus, is a very contagious and dangerous virus, with symptoms including cough, shortness of breath, fever, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, headache, and muscle pain.

The CDC recently added congestion or runny nose, nausea, and diarrhea as symptoms as well.

Who‚Äôs at risk?

Everyone is at risk. But those who are at a higher risk of getting very sick are older adults and those who suffer from heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease.

You can learn more about COVID-19 from the CDC here.

How Does it Spread?
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.

Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Can someone spread the virus without being sick?

People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).
Spreading the disease is also possible before people show symptoms.
Spread from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects

A person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.

What if I think I already had COVID-19?

You can get an antibody test to find out if this was the case. The implications of a positive antibody test are unclear at this time.

You can go to any CityMD location to receive an antibody test. Their locations are here. Northwell Health Urgent Care is also providing antibody tests. Their locations are here. Fees may apply.",Real,Fact based

So, this is more than any vaccine one need for self immunity. Without any side effects. 

Since 80% of Corona positive patients had no symptoms at all , leaves uncertainity for all of us!

Why fatalities are low in COVID 19 patients
As time passes in a pandemic there‚Äôs a greater chance of survival for those getting infected 3 months later like July 2020  than those who got infected 3 months earlier say February 2020. The reason for this is that Doctors and scientists know more about Covid-19 now than 3 months ago and hence are able to treat patients better. I will list *5 important things* that we know now that we didn‚Äôt know in February 2020 for better understanding. 

1. COVID-19 was initially thought to cause deaths due to *pneumonia- a lung infection*- and so Ventilators were thought to be the best way to treat sick patients who couldn‚Äôt breathe. *Now* we are realising that the virus  causes blood clots in the blood vessels of the lungs  and other parts of the body and this causes the reduced oxygenation . Now we know that just providing oxygen by ventilators will not help but we have to prevent and dissolve the micro clots in the lungs. This is why we are using drugs like *Asprin and Heparin* ( blood thinners that prevents clotting) as protocol in treatment regimens in June 2020.

2. Previously patients used to drop dead on the road or even before reaching a hospital due to reduced oxygen in their blood- *OXYGEN SATURATION.* This was because of *HAPPY HYPOXIA*- where even though the oxygen saturation was gradually reducing the COVID-19 patients did not have symptoms until it became critically less, like sometimes even 70%. Normally we become breathless if oxygen saturation reduces below 90%. This breathlessness is not triggered in Covid patients and so we we were getting the sick patients very late to the hospitals in February 2020. Now since knowing about *happy hypoxia,* we are monitoring oxygen saturation of all covid patients with a simple home use *pulse oxymeter* and getting them to hospital if their oxygen saturation drops to 93% or less. This gives more time for doctors to correct the oxygen deficiency in the blood and a better survival chance in July 2020.

3. We did not have drugs to fight the corona virus  in February 2020. We were only treating the complications caused by it... hypoxia. Hence most patients became severely infected. 

*Now we have 2 important medicines *FAVIPIRAVIR & REMDESIVIR*

Which are *ANTIVIRALS* that can kill the corona virus . By using these two medicines we can prevent patients from becoming severely infected and therefore cure them *BEFORE THEY GO TO HYPOXIA*. This knowledge we have in July 2020... not in February 2020. 

4. Many Covid-19 patients die not just because of the virus  but also due the patients own immune system responding In an exaggerated manner called *CYTOKINE STORM*. This stormy strong  immune response not only kills the virus but also kills the patients. In February 2020 we didn‚Äôt know how to prevent it from happening. Now in July 2020, we know that *easily available medicines called Steroids,* that doctors around the world have been using for almost 80 years and mainly *INJECTION TOCILIZUMAB can be used to prevent the cytokine storm in covid patients*.
Timely use of Inj Tocilizumab have saved many lives!

5. Now we also know that people with hypoxia became better just by making them lie down on their belly- known as prone position. Apart from this a few days ago Israeli scientists have discovered that a chemical known as *Alpha Defensin* produced by the patients White blood cells can cause the micro clots in blood vessels of the lungs and this could possibly be prevented by a drug called *Colchicine* used over many decades in the treatment of Gout.

So now we know for sure that patients have a better chance at surviving the COVID-19 infection now in July 2020 than in February 2020 for sure. India has not peaked in March or April because of the lockdown. This strategy has postponed the Covid-19 pandemic in INDIA by 3 crucial months that has enabled us to save thousands  of lives. 

Going forward there‚Äôs nothing to panic about Covid-19 if we remember that a person who gets infected later has a better chance at survival than one who got infected early. 

Let‚Äôs all follow simple precautions like:-

-6 feet distancing from others 
-Wear proper masks 
-Order delivery and take away of food groceries and vegetables 
- work from home, unnecessarily don‚Äôt go out
- Hand  wash & hygiene 

With this we can beat the virus. If someone tells you every one is going to get infected, tell them that you are willing to wait to be the last person... who knows by then we might even have a VACCINE.",Real,Opinion

,,"*Finally, some sensible advice.  From a GP Nurse in the UK.* 

*To Avoid Covid-19*
What I have seen a lot of are recommendations for how to try to avoid getting coronavirus in the first place ,
‚Ä¢ good hand washing 
‚Ä¢ personal hygiene 
‚Ä¢ social distancing 
-- but what I have NOT seen a lot of is advice for what happens if you actually get it, which many of us will. 
So as your friendly neighborhood Nurse let me make some suggestions:

*If you get Covid-19*
You basically just want to prepare as though you know you‚Äôre going to get a nasty respiratory bug, like bronchitis or pneumonia. You just have the foresight to know it might come your way!

*Things you should actually buy ahead of time* (not sure what the obsession with toilet paper is?):

‚Ä¢ *Kleenex,*

‚Ä¢ *Paracetamol*,

‚Ä¢ whatever your generic, mucus thinning *cough medicine* of choice is (check the label and make sure you're not doubling up on Paracetamol) 

‚Ä¢ *Honey and lemon* can work just as well!

‚Ä¢ *Vicks* vaporub for your chest is also a great suggestion.

‚Ä¢ *a humidifier* would be a good thing to buy and use in your room when you go to bed overnight. (You can also just turn the shower on hot and sit in the bathroom breathing in the steam). 
(May not be required in India given good humidity levels)

‚Ä¢ *If you have a history of asthma* and you have a prescription inhaler, make sure the one you have isn‚Äôt expired and refill it/get a new one if necessary.

‚Ä¢ *Meals* This is also a good time to meal prep: make a big batch of your favorite soup to freeze and have on hand.

‚Ä¢ *Hydrate (drink!) hydrate, hydrate!* Stock up on whatever  your favorite clear fluids are to drink - though tap water is fine you may appreciate some variety!

‚Ä¢ *For symptom management* and a fever over 38¬∞c, take Paracetamol rather than Ibuprofen.

‚Ä¢ *Rest lots*. You should not be leaving your house!  Even if you are feeling better you may will still be infectious for fourteen days and older people and those with existing health conditions should be avoided!

‚Ä¢ *Wear gloves and a mask* to avoid contaminating others in your house

‚Ä¢ *Isolate* in your bedroom if not living alone, ask friends and family to leave supplies outside to avoid contact.

‚Ä¢ *Sanitize* your bed linen and clothes frequently by washing and clean your bathroom with recommended sanitizers.

*You DO NOT NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL unless* you are having trouble breathing or your fever is very high (over 39¬∞C) and unmanaged with meds. 
90% of healthy adult cases thus far have been managed at home with basic rest/hydration/over-the-counter meds.

*If you are worried or in distress or feel your symptoms are getting worse* 

*Preexisting risks* If you have a pre-existing lung condition (COPD, emphysema, lung cancer) or are on immunosuppressants, now is a great time to talk to your Doctor or specialist about what they would like you to do if you get sick. 

*Children-* One major relief to you parents is that kids do VERY well with coronavirus‚Äî they usually bounce back in a few days (but they will still be infectious), Just use pediatric dosing .

*Be calm and prepare rationally* and everything will be fine.
 This is to inform us all that the pH for corona virus varies from 5.5 to 8.5.

All we need to do, to beat corona virus, we need to take more of alkaline foods that are above the pH level of the Virus. 

Some of which are:
 *Lemon - 9.9pH* 
 *Lime - 8.2pH* 
 *Avocado - 15.6pH* 
 *Garlic - 13.2pH* 
 *Mango - 8.7pH* 
 *Tangerine - 8.5pH* 
 *Pineapple - 12.7pH* 
 *Dandelion - 22.7pH* 
 *Orange - 9.2pH* 

How do you know you have coronavirus?
1. *Itching in the throat,* 
2. *Dry throat,* 
3. *Dry cough.* 
4.   High temperature 
5.   Shortness of breath

So where you notice these things quickly take warm  water with lemon  and drink.

The real shit is here üíØ

The corona Virus travelled entire world from Wuhan but it did not reach Beijing and Shanghai... can anybody put light?

Looks So Logical....After all Chinese Stock Market didn't crash....American and European Markets did....

Destroy other markets and be ready to capture them in every way

How to dominate the world quickly?

THE GREAT CHINESE STAGE

1. Create a virus and the antidote.

2. Spread the virus.

3. A demonstration of efficiency, building hospitals in a few days. After all, you were already prepared, with the projects, ordering the equipment, hiring the labor, the water and sewage network, the prefabricated building materials and stocked in an impressive volume.

4. Cause chaos in the world, starting with Europe.

5. Quickly plaster the economy of dozens of countries.

6. Stop production lines in factories in other countries.

7. Cause stock markets to fall and buy companies at a bargain price.

8. Quickly control the epidemic in your country. After all, you were already prepared.

9. Lower the price of commodities, including the price of oil you buy on a large scale.

10. Get back to producing quickly while the world is at a standstill. Buy what you negotiated cheaply in the crisis and sell more expensive what is lacking in countries that have paralyzed their industries.

PS: Pl read the book by Chinese colonels Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui, from 1999, ‚ÄúUnrestricted Warfare: China‚Äôs master plan to destroy America‚Äù, on Amazon. It's all there.

Worth pondering.. 
Just Think about  this... 

How come Russia & North Korea are totally free of Covid- 19? Because they are staunch ally of China. Not a single case reported from this 2 countries. On the other hand South Korea / United Kingdom / Italy / Spain and Asia are severely hit. How come Wuhan is suddenly free from the deadly virus?

 China will say that their drastic  initial  measures they took was very stern and Wuhan was locked down to contain the spread to other areas. I am sure they are using the Anti dode of the virus. 

Why Beijing was not hit?  Why only Wuhan? Kind of interesting to ponder upon.. right? Well ..Wuhan is open for business now. America and all the above mentioned countries are devastated financially. Soon American economy will collapse as planned by China.  China knows it CANNOT defeat America militarily as USA is at present 

THE MOST POWERFUL  country in the world. So use the virus...to cripple the economy and paralyse the nation and its Defense capabilities. I'm sure Nancy Pelosi got a part in this. . to topple Trump. Lately President Trump was always telling of how GREAT American economy was  improving in all fronts. The only way to destroy his vision of making AMERICA GREAT AGAIN is to create an economic havoc. Nancy Pelosi was unable to bring down Trump thru impeachment. ....so work along with China to destroy Trump by releasing a virus. Wuhan,s epidemic was  a showcase. At the peak of  the virus epidemic. ..

China's President Xi Jinping...just wore a simple approximately Rm1 (Rm1 = CNY 1.60 current exchange rate) facemask to visit those effected areas without any other safety precautions.  As President he should be covered from head to toe.....but it was not the case.  He was already injected to resist any harm from the virus....that means a cure was  already in place before the virus was released. 

Some may ask....Bill Gates already predicted the outbreak in 2015...so the chinese agenda cannot be true. The answer is. ..YES...Bill Gates did predict. .but that prediction is based on a genuine virus outbreak.  Now China is also telling that the virus was predicted well in advance. ....so that its agenda would play along well to match that  prediction. China,s vision is to control the World economy by buying up stocks now from countries facing the brink of severe  ECONOMIC COLLAPSE.  Later China will announce that  their Medical Researchers  have found a cure to destroy the virus.  Now China have other countries stocks in their arsenal and these countries will soon be slave to their master...CHINA.

The curtain opens: China becomes ill, enters a ""crisis"" and paralyzes its trade.  The curtain closes.

*SCENE II.*  
The curtain opens: The Chinese currency is devalued.  They do not do anything.  The curtain closes.

*SCENE III.*  
The curtain opens:: Due to the lack of trade of companies from Europe and the USA that are based in China, their shares fall 40% of their value.

*SCENE IV.*  
The curtain opens:: The world is ill, China buys 30% of the shares of companies in Europe and the US at a very low price.  The curtain closes.

*SCENE V.* 
The curtain opens: China has controlled the disease and owns companies in Europe and the US.  And he decides that these companies stay in China and earn $ 20,000Billions.  The curtain closes.  How is the play called?

 *SCENE  VI:* 
 *Checkmate!*

 *ReAmazing but true* 

Two videos have passed between yesterday and today that convinced me of something I suspected, but had no basis.  It was just my speculation.  Now I am convinced that the coronavirus was purposely propagated by the Chinese themselves.

 At first they were too prepared.  Three weeks after the start of the roll, 14 days and a 12,000-bed hospitals were already under construction.  And they really built them in two weeks.  

Awesome.

Yesterday they announced that they had stopped the epidemic.  They appear in videos celebrating, they announce that they even have a vaccine.  How could they create it so quickly without having all the genetic information?  Well if you are the owner of the formula it is not difficult at all.
 And today I just saw a video that explains how Den Xiao Ping gave the west a half stick.  Due to the coronavirus, the actions of Western companies in China fell dramatically.  China I just hope, when they went down enough they bought them.  Now the companies, Created by the USA and Europe in China with all the technology put in by these exchanges and their capital they passed into the hands of China, which is now rising with all that technological potential and will be able to set prices at will to sell everything they need to the West.  How are you?

 None of this could have happened by chance.  China who cared that a few old men died?  Fewer old-age pensions to pay, but the loot has been huge.  And right now the West is financially defeated, in crisis and stunned by the disease.  And without knowing what to do.

Masterfully diabolic.  It had to be the communists.  |

Adding to this, they are now the single largest owners of US treasury with 1.18 trillion holding surpassing Japan.

Is it because they are staunch allies of China

On the other hand USA / South Korea / United Kingdom / France / Italy / Spain and Asia are severely hit

How come Wuhan is suddenly free from the deadly virus? 

China says that the drastic initial measures that they took were very stern and Wuhan was locked down to contain the spread to other areas

Why Beijing was not hit ? Why only Wuhan? 

It is interesting to ponder upon.. right ? 

Well ..Wuhan is open for business now

America and all the above mentioned countries are devastated financially

[3/23, 8:51 AM] Ravin: ‚ÄúWhat I have seen are a lot of recommendations for how to try to avoid getting coronavirus.... good hand washing, personal hygiene and social distancing. But ...what I have NOT seen is advice for what happens if you do actually get it, which many of us will. 
So as your friendly neighborhood Nurse let me make some suggestions:

Basically you just want to prepare as though you know you‚Äôre going to get a nasty respiratory bug, like bronchitis or pneumonia. 

Things you should actually buy ahead of time (not sure what the obsession with toilet paper is?):
Augmentin Duo 625 mg
Paracetamol/ Dolo 650
A mucus thinning cough medicine of your choice. (Honey and lemon can work just as well)
Vit. C and zinc lozenges.
Vicks vaporub for a chest rub

If you don‚Äôt have a humidifier, buy one now and use in your room when you go to bed at night. 
You can also just turn the shower on hot and sit in the bathroom breathing in the steam during the day. 

If you have a history of asthma and use a prescription inhaler, make sure the one you have isn‚Äôt expired and refill it or get a new one if necessary.

This is also a good time to meal prep: Make a big batch of your favorite soup to freeze and have on hand. 
Chicken soup is the best! 

For symptom management and a fever over 98.4 ‚Ä¢F, take Paracetamol. NEVER IBUPROFEN.

Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate! Drink hot water and clear non sugary drinks. 

Rest a lot. You should not be leaving your house!  Even if you are feeling better you may will still be infectious for fourteen days and older people and those with existing health conditions should be avoided!

YOU DO NOT NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL unless you are having severe trouble breathing or your fever is very high (over 102‚Ä¢F ) and remains unmanaged with meds. 
90% of healthy adult cases thus far have been managed at home with basic rest and hydration and over-the-counter meds.

If you are worried or in distress or feel your symptoms are getting worse, phone your doctor. 
If you have a pre-existing lung condition like COPD, emphysema, asthma, lung cancer or are on immunosuppressants, talk to your Doctor about what they would like you to do, if you get sick. 

Be calm. 
Prepare rationally.
Everything will be fine.

,,"*Msg from Sadhguru üëá. Let‚Äôs try to do for a day and then see the difference* 

*‚ÄúWhatever we are talking about is what we are perpetuating in our experience. The only way to keep any kind of illness or virus or flu away is to not talk about it and it will dissipate itself. What we do instead is keep checking the statistics or keep spreading the ""awareness"" messages on social media without noticing it that the more we talk about it the more it becomes active in our vibration. History is full of evidence of epidemics because of the mass consciousness created by fear of the disease. Fear is a very strong vibration and more fearful we are of any epidemic it becomes a reality very fast.. it's the law. The more you feed the energy of fear the more profound it becomes. Ignore the things you don't want to participate in. Stop discussing it with family and friends; stop checking out the latest statistics. Stop watching incessantly the news about Corona Virus. Take your attention away and It has no power on you. The creation of anything is to give thought to it by keeping it active in our vibration by being afraid of it. Hook yourself up with  ever flowing stream of well- being‚Äù.*
